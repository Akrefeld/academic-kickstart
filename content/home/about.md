### About

I am a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Geneva in the Faculty of Economics and Management. I am a trained psychologist enjoying the multidisciplinarity at a Business School. My main research interest lies in understanding the fundamental cognitive processes of decision making, to understand and predict observable phenomena, such as seqeuntial effects in choices or the influence of visual cueing on information search.
To make these cognitive processes better measurable and observable, I use process tracing methods, computational models and experimental research methods.
